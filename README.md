About ruby-nfc
========

This gem brings some NFC functionality for Ruby programming language.
It allows to:
* Read and modify contents of Mifare tags
* Send APDU commands to Android HCE or Blackberry VTE devices
* Communicate with dual-interface smart cards like Master Card PayPass or Visa payWave cards

Prerequisites
------------

* Install libusb first. For Ubuntu run:
  ```
  apt-get install libusb-dev
  ```
* Download and install [libnfc](https://bintray.com/nfc-tools/sources/libnfc). Ruby-nfc currently works with 1.7.x branch
  
  ```
  # tar xjvf libnfc-1.7.1.tar.bz2
  # cd libnfc-1.7.1/
  # ./configure
  # make && make install
  ```
  
  Or if you're using Ubuntu Utopic Unicorn or higher version Ðµnable "Universe" repository and then run:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install libfreefare-bin
  ```
  You may need to copy some system files from libnfc tarball anyway:

    ```
    sudo cp ./contrib/linux/blacklist-libnfc.conf /etc/modprobe.d/
    sudo cp ./contrib/udev/42-pn53x.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
    ```
* Download and install [libfreefare](https://code.google.com/p/libfreefare/):
  ```
  # git clone https://code.google.com/p/libfreefare/
  # cd libfreefare
  # autoreconf -vis
  # ./configure && make && make install
  ```
  
* Look at lsusb output and make sure that your reader is present in 42-pn53x.rules
* Install appropriate driver for your NFC reader (if required)
* If your reader is plugged in unplug it and plug it again. If you run example below and get "Device or resource busy" error then you need to reboot your system before you can continue.

Installation
------------
```
gem install ruby-nfc
```

Usage
-----

```ruby
require 'ruby-nfc'

puts "Library version: %s" % NFC.version
readers = NFC::Reader.all
puts "Available readers: %s" % readers.to_s

# The order of tag types in poll arguments defines priority of tag types
readers[0].poll(IsoDep::Tag, Mifare::Classic::Tag, Mifare::Ultralight::Tag, NFC::Tag) do |tag|
  begin
  	puts "Applied #{tag.class.name}: #{tag}"

		case tag
		when Mifare::Classic::Tag
  		tag.select do
  			# Perform authentication to block 0x04 with the Key A that equals 
  			# to "\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF" you can also use "FFFFFFFFFFFF"
  			# representation. In this case it will be automatically packed to 6 bytes
  			if auth(4, :key_a, "FFFFFFFFFFFF")
					puts "authenticated!"
					processed! # mark tag as processed so even if it supports different
										 # protocol poll method will continue with another physical
										 # tag
  			end
  		end
  	when Mifare::Ultralight::Tag
  		tag.select do
  			puts "Page 1: %s" % read(1).unpack('H*').pop
  			processed!
  		end
		when IsoDep::Tag
			aid = ["F75246544101"].pack('H*')
			tag.select(aid) do
				# sending APDU command to tag using send_apdu method
				apdu = ['A00D010018B455CAF0F331AF703EFA2E2D744EC7E22AA64076CD19F6D0'].pack('H*')
				puts send_apdu(apdu).unpack('H*').pop

				# sending APDU command with "<<" operator which is alias to send_apdu
				# response = tag << apdu
				# puts response.unpack('H*').pop
				processed!
			end
		end
  rescue Exception => e
    puts e
  end
end

```

This example should provide similar output when you apply your tags to NFC-reader:
```
Library version: 1.7.1
Available readers: [acr122_usb:001:009]
Applied Mifare::Classic::Tag: bde74d1d Mifare Classic 4k SAK: 0x18
authenticated!
Applied Mifare::Classic::Tag: 25161b49 Infineon Mifare Classic 1k SAK: 0x88
authenticated!
Applied Mifare::Ultralight::Tag: 04a42572373080 Mifare UltraLight SAK: 0x0
